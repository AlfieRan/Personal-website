# Personal-website

This is my personal website hosted at https://alfieranstead.com.
I change the code regularly, but it all stays in this repository,
which is why the utils folder has a bunch of unused functions which are from old commits.

Feel free to reuse any of the code in this repository, but please credit me somewhere in whatever project you use it in.
